We believe that a quality computer science education should be available to every child, not just a lucky few.\r\n\r\nTo support our goal, we do work across the education spectrum: designing our own courses or partnering with others, training teachers, partnering with large school districts, helping change government policies, expanding internationally via partnerships, and marketing to break stereotypes.\r\n\r\nOur work builds upon decades of effort, by countless organizations and individuals who have helped establish, fund, and spread computer science education.

This video became #1 on YouTube for a day, and 15,000 schools reached out to us for help.

We believe that a quality computer science education should be available to every child, not just a lucky few.\r\n\r\nTo support our goal, we do work across the education spectrum: designing our own courses or partnering with others, training teachers, partnering with large school districts, helping change government policies, expanding internationally via partnerships, and marketing to break stereotypes.\r\n\r\nOur work builds upon decades of effort, by countless organizations and individuals who have helped establish, fund, and spread computer science education.
